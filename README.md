# Description
Square Eyes was my submission for the first JavaScript assignment we had at Noroff Univeristy. 

I created a mock up off an E-commerce site called "Square Eyes", a page dedicated to connecting movie lovers. 

Using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript I built:
- A homepage displaying all movies
- A single movie page for displaying more detailed info about the movies where you could add them to the cart
- A shopping cart where you could remove items or proceed to checkout
- A check-out confirmation page

The movie and details were imported by using an API, and the shopping cart was made "funtcional" by using local storage.

# Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

# How to Install
1. Clone Repository
2. Open with VS Code
3. Open Index.html page with live server

# Credits
- Movie pictures and info are from the Noroff API
